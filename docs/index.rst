DoNOF: Donostia Natural Orbital Functional open-source program
##############################################################

DoNOF is an open-source implementation of natural-orbital-functional-based methods for quantum chemistry.

The DoNOF computer program is designed to solve the energy
minimization problem of a natural-orbital-functional (NOF)
that describes the ground-state of an N-electron
system at absolute zero temperature. The program includes the NOFs developed
in the Donostia quantum chemistry group, namely PNOFi [i=3-7]. The
solution is established by optimizing the energy functional with respect to the
occupation numbers and to the natural orbitals, separately.
