# Single Point ENERGY

You can run a single point energy calculation USING THE `RUNTYP='ENERGY'` in the `&INPRUN` as in the following example:
~~~
 &INPRUN RUNTYP='ENERGY' MULT=1 ICHARG=0 ERITYP='FULL' /
 $DATA
 Water (H2O)
 cc-pVDZ
O  8.0  0.0000     0.0000    0.1173
H  1.0  0.0000     0.7572   -0.4692
H  1.0  0.0000    -0.7572   -0.4692
 $END
 &NOFINP IPNOF=8 /
~~~

You can identify specific information inside the `$DATA` block, as the `title` (Water (H2O)), the `basis name` (cc-pVDZ), and the `XYZ geometry`. Notice that the atomic number of each atom is indicated.
