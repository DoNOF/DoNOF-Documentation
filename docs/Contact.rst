The DoNOF code is open-source, and thus we appreciate any contribution to the code, such as

    Ideas of missing features

    Ideas for improving documentation

    Bugs in the code or output

    Errors in the documentation

    New tutorials

It is preferable to get in touch through GitHub, at https://github.com/DoNOF/DoNOFsw. As usual, you have to FORK DoNOF, make the corresponding modifications in your own FORK, and finally do a PULL REQUEST to the main/master repository of DoNOF. Remember that you can clone the master DoNOF repository, but since you have read-only permission, you cannot PUSH to the master branch.

Otherwise, you can contact us by e-mail to DoNOFsw@gmail.com
